# Requirements:
#   - Ruby 3.2.3
#   - rest-client:
#      - gem install ffi
#      - gem install rest-client
# This Ruby example send the data via post request to one of the APIs avaiable by Amicci. 
# It's a generic code, and simulates fictional number of data to be sent.
# The code iterates over a bunch of data and send a maximum number of data each time. The current maximum data
# per request is 20000.  
# The number of the requests to the API will depend on the ammount of data, because it has to respect
# the maximum data per request. 
# The data should be grouped and send the maximum possible at once.
